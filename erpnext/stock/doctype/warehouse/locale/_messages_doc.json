 "Warehouse", 
 "A logical Warehouse against which stock entries are made.\n\nThere are two main Warehouse Types that are significant in ERPNext.\n\n1. **Stores:** These are where your incoming **Items** are kept before they are consumed or sold. You can have as many \u201cStores\u201d type **Warehouses** as you wish. Stores type warehouses are significant because if you set an Item for automatic re-order, ERPNext will check its quantities in all \u201cStores\u201d type **Warehouses** when deciding whether to re-order or not.\n\n2. **Asset**: **Items** marked as type \u201cFixed Asset\u201d are maintained in Asset Type **Warehouses**. This helps you separate them for the **Items** that are consumed as a part of your regular operations or \u201cCost of Goods Sold\u201d.\n",
