 "Account", 
 "An **Account** is heading under which financial and business transactions are carried on. For example, \u201cTravel Expense\u201d is an account, \u201cCustomer Zoe\u201d, \u201cSupplier Mae\u201d are accounts. \n\n**Note:** ERPNext creates accounts for Customers and Suppliers automatically.\n\n### Groups and Ledgers\n\nThere are two main kinds of Accounts in ERPNext - Group and Ledger. Groups can have sub-groups and ledgers within them, whereas ledgers are the leaf nodes of your chart and cannot be further classified.\n\nAccounting Transactions can only be made against Ledger Accounts (not Groups)\n",
